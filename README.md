#Get Off My Lawn

##What Does It Do?

If the site's current url matches the `live_url` property defined in the plugin file, Reading Settings > Visibility is automatically set to allow search engines. The reverse is also true. If they do not match, search engines will be discouraged.

##Usage

1. Edit the `public_url` setting on line 36.
1. Upload the plugin file to `mu_plugins`.
